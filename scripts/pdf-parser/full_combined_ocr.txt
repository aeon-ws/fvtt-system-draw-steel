Delian Tomb.

SKULL SIGIL

The skull sigil animates the dead in this room. The sigil is an
object with 80 Stamina and corruption, poison, and psychic
immunity all and holy weakness 5. Whenever the sigil takes
damage, each creature in a space that touches the sigil takes
1d6 lightning damage.

When the sigil is destroyed, the undead in this room die.

As a maneuver, a hero can make an easy Reason test to
examine the skull:

e $11: The hero must connect their mind to skull’s magic
to discover its nature. Doing so causes 5 psychic damage
to the hero, but they also learn that the symbol is what’s
causing the dead to rise in this room and keeping them
animated.

¢ 12-16: The hero knows that the symbol can cause the
dead to rise in this room and keep them animated.

¢ 17+: As 12-16 except the hero can choose to deal 10
damage to the sigil as part of the test.

ENCOUNTER ADJUSTMENTS

If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:

e For six heroes, add two skeletons.

e For four heroes, remove two ghouls. The sigil has 60
Stamina.

e For three heroes, remove four ghouls. The sigil has 40
Stamina.

TACTICS

These undead are mindless and lack much in the way of
tactical thinking. Each undead creature targets the closest
enemy they can on their turn. The ghouls run into the fray,
leaping at targets to knock them down. Skeletons remain at
range to shoot targets with their bows. The zombies use
Zombie Dust as Malice allows, typically at the start of their
turn so they can stand after using it.

The undead do not leave this room.

ENDING THE ENCOUNTER

The undead fight until destroyed. If the heroes destroy the
undead or the skull sigil, they earn 1 Victory.

e For four heroes, remove one group of two goblin
warriors.

e For three heroes, remove one group of two goblin
warriors and one goblin warrior and the four
spinecleavers the warrior captained.

STAIR WARD

The magic ward that covers the stairs makes the floor in
this room immune to all damage and indestructible.

When a creature touches the ward, any forced movement
currently affecting them ends as if they had hit a wall, they
take 3 lightning damage, and they are teleported up to 5
squares away into an unoccupied space of your choice that
doesn’t include the ward (typically a place that is far from
where the creature would like to be).

The ward can be overcome with the Amulet of the Delian
Order (see Treasure). If the ward is lifted, the heroes can
enter the second level of the Delian Tomb (see Tomb
Second Level in Part 2: Broadhurst and Environs).

VIOLET

While Violet, a civilian, is in the room and the channeler is
alive and perfomring the ritual, Violet can’t regain stamina,
her speed is 0, and she loses 2 stamina at the end of each
round once combat starts. Ifher stamina drops to 0 in this
way, she dies and the ward to the stairs is destroyed ina
brilliant crackle of lighting.

A hero who can reach Violet can cut her free or untie her as
a maneuver. A hero carrying Violet who has a Might score
of 1 or lower is slowed while they carry her. Removing
Violet from the room or defeating the channeler ends the
effects on her.

The goblins avoid harming Violet, since they want the ritual
to kill her. While under the effect of the ritual, she is
considered a goblin and their ally for the purposes of the
goblin’s abilities and Malice features.

Shared Ferocity
The Director gains 1d3 malice the first time a creature uses an
ability that costs ferocity while within line of effect of the
werewolf.

Accursed Rage
The werewolf’s ferocity is expressed through rage. Their abilities
are capable of inflicting rage points on enemies (excluding
stormwight furies).
If a creature has 10 or more rage at the start of their turn, they
expend all of their rage, shift up to their speed towards the
nearest creature, and make a melee free strike against them. A
creature that takes damage in this way gains 1 rage. All
accumulated rage disappears after completing a respite.

ENCOUNTER ADJUSTMENTS

If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:

e For six heroes, add two skeletons.
e For four heroes, remove two skeletons.
e For three heroes, remove all four skeletons.

TACTICS

If the heroes approach the altar, the wallmaster opens the
walls and ambushes the party. The skeletons aim to pepper
the heroes with arrows to try and bait them to enter the
niches, where the wallmaster can trap them away from the
rest of the party. Meanwhile, the two soulwights move to
guard the door out. If it looks like the heroes are going to
make a break for it with the shield half, the wallmaster tries
to block the exit as quickly as possible.

ENDING THE ENCOUNTER

If the wallmaster and both soulwights are defeated, the
remaining creatures crumble. Alternatively, if the heroes all
exit this room, the monsters do not pursue. Leaving the
room with the right half of the Delian Shield awards each
hero 1 Victory.

COOKFIRE

The first time a creature touches the cookfire in the mess
tent on a turn or starts their turn touching it, they take 2
fire damage.

TRAINING GROUNDS

In the center of the fort’s open courtyard, fighting dummies
and archery targets sit waiting to be pummeled, shot, or
stabbed as part of the bandits’ training regimen. Each
dummy has sharp spear and dagger extensions that are
harmless when training. A creature force moved into a
space containing a fighting dummy takes an additional 5
damage, and then the dummy is destroyed.

TACTICS

If the heroes are outside the palisade when the alarm is
raised, then the trickshot, archers, and rogues climb to the
top of the palisade and prepare ranged strikes against

oncoming heroes while the scoundrel and raiders put up
the fort door then stand before it and await intruders.

If the heroes are inside when the alarm is raised, raiders
and the scoundrel move to engage them in melee while the
rest of the humans use ranged abilities. The bandits spread
the damage around, hoping to hamper all the heroes at
once instead of one at a time.

ENDING THE ENCOUNTER

When the heroes outnumber the bandits, the remaining
bandits flee and each hero earns 1 Victory.

ENCOUNTER F6

The heroes battle war spiders, spindelgoths, and possibly
Queen Bargnot beneath Castle Andreas.

F6 Groups
Group Creatures
1 One war spider
2 One war spider
3 Two spindelgoths
4 One goblin monarch (Queen Bargnot; optional)

ENCOUNTER ADJUSTMENTS

If this encounter has more or fewer than five heroes, make
the following adjustments:

e For six heroes, add two spindlegoths into their own
group.

e For four heroes, remove two spindlegoths.

e For three heroes, remove one war spider and one
spindlegoth.

WEBBING

Large patches of the floor are covered in webs and are
considered difficult terrain. The spindlegoths have
concealment while occupying a webbed square.

TACTICS

The arachnoids want to restrain their prey to feed on them
over time. If the heroes are especially nimble, the war
spiders focus on trampling whomever they can.

Queen Bargnot may have fled from Encounter F5 to here.
She can’t use her Get In Here maneuver down here. She
focuses on survival and clings to the walls where she can. If
any other goblins make it down into the cavern, she yells at
them in Szetch to “Kill! Kill! Kill!”

ENDING THE ENCOUNTER

The arachnoids fight until the heroes leave or all the war
spiders are reduced to 0 Stamina. If Queen Bargnot is
defeated here, she fights until reduced to 0 Stamina, making
a desperate last stand. Any remaining goblins flee or
surrender when Queen Bargnot falls.

If the heroes defeat the war spiders and spindlegoths, they
gain 1 Victory each. They gain 1 additional Victory each if
Queen Bargnot is defeated.

MYSTIC GOBLINS

Imbued with the power of the Cup of Iulius, these goblins
have become super charged soldiers. They've grown larger
and now embody the might of the warriors of old.

Queen Bargnot already leads an imposing number of
goblins within the Jagged Edge. If enough of them were to
sip from the sacred cup, she could take claim to the entire
region all on her own.

TRANSFORMED

The mystic goblins are transformed versions of the
following goblins:

e The goblin assassin has become the goblin shadowknife

e The goblin cursespitter became the goblin deathtongue

e The goblin stinker has become the goblin toxinaut

e The goblin underboss became the goblin mastermind

e The goblin warrior has become the goblin battleborn

e Queen Bargnot, who originally used the goblin monarch
stat block, has become Mystic Queen Bargnot

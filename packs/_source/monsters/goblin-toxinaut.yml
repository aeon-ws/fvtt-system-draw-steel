      text: The area is filled with a green haze until the start of the toxinaut's
        next turn or until the toxinaut is reduced to Stamina 0. The area is difficult
        terrain for non-goblin creatures, and each such creature who moves within
        the area takes 2 poison damage for each square moved. The poison damage ignores
        immunity. The haze can't be dispersed by wind.

      text: The toxinaut doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from enemies by moving.
        Whenever the toxinaut is adjacent to an enemy and willingly moves to a space
        no longer adjacent to that enemy, the toxinaut can make an opportunity attack
        against them as a triggered action.

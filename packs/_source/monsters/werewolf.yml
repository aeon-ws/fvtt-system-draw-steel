          The werewolf's ferocity is expressed through rage. Their abilities are
          capable of inflicting rage points on enemies (excluding stormwight furies).
          If a creature has 10 or more rage at the start of their turn, they expend
          all of their rage, shift up to their speed towards the nearest creature, and
          make a melee free strike against them. A creature that takes damage in this
          way gains 1 rage. All accumulated rage disappears after completing a respite.

    maliceEffect:
      text: 2 Malice Instead of being force moved, a size 1L or smaller target is
        A<1 restrained (save ends). While restrained by this ability, the target moves
        with the gelatinous ball. When restrained ends, the target moves to the nearest
        unoccupied square adjacent to the gelatinous ball. Rolling Whenever the gelatinous
        ball uses a move action or is force moved horizontally, it must move in a
        straight line until it reaches its maximum speed or until a creature or object
        is directly in front of it.

    prePowerRollEffect:
      text: The gelatinous ball can move through spaces as if it were size 1T. When
        it takes damage, it can use a free triggered action to split into two gelatinous
        balls, splitting their current Stamina in half between them. The new creature
        has none of the benefits, effects, or conditions that the original has.

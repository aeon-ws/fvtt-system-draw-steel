      text: Gorek has an edge on strikes against a grabbed creature. Overwhelm Once
        per turn, when Gorek force moves a target or shifts into a square adjacent
        to a creature or object, he can make a free strike against them. Great Fortitude
        Gorek can't be weakened. Rivalry Gorek selects one creature within line of
        effect at the start of an encounter. Both Gorek and the creature can add a
        1d3 to all power rolls made against each other.
